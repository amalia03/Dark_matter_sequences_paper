# Dark_matter_sequences_section
In this repository you will find scripts that were used for the research paper "The dark matter of environmental transcriptomics: what information can we obtain from priorly unannotated benthic mRNA sequences?" (currently unpublished). Below is the process we follow to analyse our data. Some scipts are located in different depositories and noted as such. 

## 1. Keeping the longest sequences and partitioning the sequences to mapped and unmapped. 
## 2. Kmer analysis
## 3. ORF analysis
## 4. Protein discovery analysis
